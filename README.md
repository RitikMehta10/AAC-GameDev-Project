# AAC GameDev Project
This project is to practice game development in Unity by creating a Racing Game.

The finer details of this project will be decided as we build the game.

For now, the objectives are:
* Make a racing game, possibly make it multiplayer.
* Add different levels to the game. (i.e. different maps)
* If we have time, make the whole thing space themed.

The name of the game will probably be decided once the game is done.
